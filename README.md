# Thinking with AI: Claude vs ChatGPT – How I Evaluate and Build with LLMs

*"I don't just interact with AI—I interrogate it, test it, and learn from it."*

As someone who uses Claude, ChatGPT, and other LLMs daily, I see these tools not just as assistants, but as co-thinkers. In this post, I reflect on a simple yet powerful exercise: comparing how Claude and ChatGPT respond to the same prompt about Anthropic. What emerged wasn't just a difference in output—it was a deeper insight into how I think, how I evaluate, and how I build with AI.

## The Prompt: Why Anthropic?
I wanted a compelling 2-line answer to the question: "Why Anthropic?" Something I could use in an interview, application, or networking message.

Here was the Claude response:

> "You're right to question my assessment. Let me analyze this more carefully:
>
> What made ChatGPT's response stronger:
>
> It used first-person perspective, making it feel like your authentic voice
>
> It directly connected your experience to Anthropic's mission with phrases like 'safe and interpretable AI'
>
> It balanced technical qualifications with value alignment
>
> It conveyed enthusiasm for the company's mission
>
> What was missing in my response:
>
> I didn't use first-person perspective, making it sound less personal and compelling
>
> I didn't specifically mention Anthropic's ethical AI approach or constitutional AI principles
>
> I focused too much on what you could do for them without showing alignment with their values
>
> I didn't highlight your RAG implementation experience explicitly, which is directly relevant
>
> I didn't convey passion for Anthropic's mission
>
> My response was more transactional and generic, while ChatGPT's response showed both qualification and mission alignment, which is particularly important for a values-driven company like Anthropic."

This was an impressive act of self-reflection by Claude. But it also triggered my reflection.

## My Product Mindset: How I Evaluate LLMs
When I read model outputs, I ask:

- Is the response in the first person? Does it sound authentic?
- Does it align with the mission and values of the target audience?
- Does it connect my personal experience to the company's purpose?
- Does it show technical depth and emotional intelligence?

This mindset comes from years of:

- Working in customer success and product implementation
- Conducting root cause analysis for complex client issues
- Building LLM/RAG-based prototypes for real-world use cases

## The ChatGPT Response (Refined)
Here's the version ChatGPT helped me craft, which I ultimately used:

> "Anthropic's commitment to developing helpful, harmless AI strongly aligns with my hands-on experience implementing LLM solutions and building RAG-based applications. With a background that bridges AI development and customer success, I'm uniquely positioned to support users while delivering actionable product insights. Having built a personal chatbot using RAG architecture, I deeply understand the technical and ethical considerations in AI deployment—resonating with Anthropic's constitutional approach to safe AI."

Why this works:

- First-person, authentic voice
- Clear mission alignment with Anthropic
- Emphasizes product mindset and customer empathy
- Highlights technical projects (RAG chatbot)

## What This Reveals About Me
I evaluate models with intention. I don't accept outputs at face value.

I build with purpose. My AI projects aren't just technical experiments—they're aligned with user value.

I think systemically. Whether analyzing model outputs, user pain points, or business goals, I connect the dots.

## Why This Matters to Anthropic
Anthropic isn't just building powerful models—it's building safe, interpretable, mission-aligned models. That requires:

- Empathy for users
- Deep curiosity about how models behave
- The discipline to ask tough questions

I bring all of that. And I show it.

## Let's Talk
If you're at Anthropic (or a company like it) and you're building the future of responsible AI, I'd love to connect. I think with AI, I build with users in mind, and I believe in aligning technology with values.
