# Thinking with AI: Claude vs ChatGPT – How I Evaluate and Build with LLMs

*"I don't just interact with AI—I interrogate it, test it, and learn from it."*

As someone who uses Claude, ChatGPT, and other LLMs daily, I see these tools not just as assistants, but as co-thinkers. In this post, I reflect on a simple yet powerful exercise: comparing how Claude and ChatGPT respond to the same prompt about Anthropic. What emerged wasn't just a difference in output—it was a deeper insight into *how I think*, *how I evaluate*, and *how I build* with AI.

## The Prompt: Why Anthropic?

I wanted a compelling 2-line answer to the question: *"Why Anthropic?"* Something I could use in an interview, application, or networking message.

Here was the Claude response:

> "You're right to question my assessment. Let me analyze this more carefully:
> 
> What made ChatGPT's response stronger:
> * It used first-person perspective, making it feel like your authentic voice
> * It directly connected your experience to Anthropic's mission with phrases like 'safe and interpretable AI'
> * It balanced technical qualifications with value alignment
> * It conveyed enthusiasm for the company's mission
> 
> What was missing in my response:
> * I didn't use first-person perspective, making it sound less personal and compelling
> * I didn't specifically mention Anthropic's ethical AI approach or constitutional AI principles
> * I focused too much on what you could do for them without showing alignment with their values
> * I didn't highlight your RAG implementation experience explicitly, which is directly relevant
> * I didn't convey passion for Anthropic's mission
> 
> My response was more transactional and generic, while ChatGPT's response showed both qualification and mission alignment, which is particularly important for a values-driven company like Anthropic.
